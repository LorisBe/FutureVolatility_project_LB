# AI Usage Statement

This project was developed with the assistance of AI-based tools, primarily **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**, used as a learning and productivity aid throughout the development process.

The use of AI tools strictly followed the course guidelines and focused on understanding, debugging, and improving the quality of the project, rather than delegating the full implementation to AI.

## AI Tools Used
- **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**

## How AI Tools Were Used

AI assistance was used in the following ways:

### 1. Debugging and Error Resolution
- Understanding Python error messages and stack traces
- Diagnosing environment and dependency issues (e.g. Conda environments, package imports)
- Fixing runtime and logical errors in data processing and model evaluation code

### 2. Learning New Libraries and Concepts
- Understanding how to use financial data libraries such as `yfinance`
- Learning how to structure machine-learning workflows using `scikit-learn`
- Clarifying concepts related to volatility, drawdown, rolling statistics, and regression metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE)

### 3. Code Review and Design Suggestions
- Improving code structure and modularity
- Discussing best practices for separating data handling, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation
- Reviewing function logic to ensure correctness and readability

### 4. Documentation and Report Writing
- Assistance in drafting explanations for the methodology, results, and discussion sections of the report
- Help in improving clarity, grammar, and academic tone of written sections
- Structuring explanations for code components and project workflow

### 5. Project Presentation Preparation
- Preparing explanations of the code and results for a recorded presentation
- Helping structure a clear narrative to explain the project to a teaching assistant

## What AI Tools Were NOT Used For

- AI did **not** generate the full project automatically
- AI did **not** replace understanding of the code
